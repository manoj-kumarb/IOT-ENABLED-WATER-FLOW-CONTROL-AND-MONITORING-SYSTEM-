The storage tanks are an integral part of process manufacturing. They come in different shapes and sizes, and their contents vastly vary from chemical fluids and liquids. Nevertheless, irrespective of their applications, effective tank level monitoring and control are imperative to any industrial operation. Basically, in periodical water supplying systems the people need to have regular monitoring of water taps to check whether the water has come or not. It becomes very much Burdon for continuous observation. The second problem is, to store the water in the water tank, one should first check the level of tank and if it is needed to be filled, manually the valve and water pump should be turned-on and turned-off to stop filling tank. To overcome these problems and optimizing of total water monitoring and controlling in domestic applications in a reliable way is the important objective of this system. As a monitoring system, it senses the presence of water in tap/pipe, water level in tanks or storages, force of water flow. Sends all these information to user by connecting the whole water system to internet and controlling using Wi-Fi module. As soon as getting all the information to his/her mobile device, he/she can send control signal to turn on/off valves, make water pump on/off to shift the water to tanks or storages and can continuously monitor the status of total system.
